          In 2019, Syria has entered its eighth year of the Civil War between the Assad Regime and various opposition groups including the Kurds and ISIS. Syrian Civil War has fragmented the country into different regions under the control of different political groups, causing death of hundred thousands of civilians, the largest displacement since World War II, and the widespread food insecurity.
        </h3>

        <p>
          According to Humanitarian Needs Overview, there are around 6.5 million food-insecure Syrians, and 2.5 millions are at risk of food insecurity ("Global Report" 136). Food insecurity in Syria is caused by the ongoing Civil War, exacerbated by 2017-18 drought, destroying the country’s economy and agricultural production, disrupting trades and markets, blocking humanitarian assistance,  diminishing government-sponsored food subsidies, sharply increasing food prices, and causing loss of livelihood and disability.
        </p>

            Economic Destruction
          </h2>

          <p>
            First, Syrian Civil War has destroyed the country’s economy, especially the agriculture sector. Before 2011 Civil War, GDP was 60.04 billion dollars, and the growth rate of the real GDP was 3.44% in 2010 (“Syria” 18-20). Since 2011, Syria has suffered from the severe economic recession; that is, nominal GDP from 58.9 billion dollars in 2011 dropped to 14 billion dollars in 2015, and the percentage change in GDP dropped to -15 % in 2015 ("Syrian Civil" 27- 28). All the sectors of Syrian economy have been destroyed by the war. Among them, the agriculture sector has been severely impacted.
          </p>

          <p>
            The agriculture sector, which made up 17.94% in total GDP in 2007, was devastated (“Syria” 22). According to Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission by WFP and FAO, Syrian food production hit a record low in 2016; that is, compared to pre-conflict average, there is 55% decrease in wheat production to 1.5 million tons, 30% decrease in cattle, 40% in sheep and goats, and 60% in poultry (“Humanitarian Food” 1). The war has caused massive civilian deaths and displacement of people, many of them were employed in the agricultural sector; as a result, this has caused labor shortage for the food production. Also, destruction of farmland, irrigation systems, food processing factories, and power plants have led to sharp decline in agricultural production.
          </p>

          <h2 class="content-section-title">
            Trade and Market Disruption
          </h2>

          <p>
            Furthermore, Syrian Civil War has disrupted trades and markets, blocking humanitarian aid. There is around 2.2 percent of the total length of inner-city road in the cities of Aleppo, Dar'a, Hama, Homs, Idlib, and Latakia directly damaged; among them, Aleppo accounts for 49.8% and Homs for 18% ("Economics" 37). The destruction of roads has blocked the delivery of food from surplus and food production regions to food-deprived regions. And even if the food is able to reach the food-deprived regions, the food price would escalate due to the expensive transport cost.
          </p>

          <p>
            The situation becomes dire when the country has been fragmented into different regions under control of the Assad regime or various opposition forces such as the Kurds and ISIS (Gobat 7). Among these regions, many areas are besieged or become hard-to-reach where food deliveries from outside or humanitarian aid cannot reach besieging Syrians. In the article “Besieged Syrian Town of Madaya Finally Gets Aid ” Rebecca Collard notes that there are 400,000 people living under besieged areas in Syria where hunger become a war weapon; she describes the desperate situation of Syrians in Madaya, Syria, a besiege rebel-held region; Madaya villagers haven’t eaten for days; their village are surrounded by landmines, and they are scared of being shot if they try to leave; and the transport of humanitarian aid to the starving civilians in Madaya could only be allowed to enter the village after a deal between opposition forces and the government was reached (Collard).

            Sharp Decrease in Goverment Subsidies
          </h2>

          <p>
            In addition, many Syrians meet their basic needs through government-subsidized food; however, ongoing conflicts, destruction of flour mills, bakeries and wheat collection centers, and sharp decline in government revenue, especially from oil exports, have led to decrease in government subsidies. Wheat in form of bread accounts for 40% of Syrian major calorie intake, and the supply of wheat, flour, and bread is mainly under control of the Assad government; the regime subsidizes the wheat production in form of the payment of premium prices to farmers, and subsidize its citizens with bread at a lower price than the market ("Syria 2025"  11). However, Syrian government increased the price of bread from 25 to 35 Syrian pounds on January 17, 2015 (Martinez).

            Severe Droughts
          </h2>

          <p>
            Moreover, severe drought and late heavy rain in Syria have aggravated the severity of food insecurity in Syria. The worst drought in 30 years, followed by heavy rain and high temperature, together with constant conflicts, have made the wheat production hit its record low in 30 years ("Global Report" 138). The largest impact of the drought is on north-east Syria, Al-Hasakeh Governorate, which accounts for 50-75 percent of national wheat production before Civil War ("Humanitarian Needs" 27).
          </p>

          <p>
            The climate shocks even have exacerbated the severe hunger in Syria, as they decrease wheat production.  Wheat is Syrians’ main source of calorie consumption. As a consequence, it drives the country food inflation even higher. Furthermore, people in Al-Hasakeh are severely suffered from the drought. More than 60% of Al-Hasakeh civilians are employed in agriculture and animal husbandry ("Humanitarian Needs" 27). The climate shocks not only badly affect their livelihood but also their food intake.
          </p>

          <h2 class="content-section-title">
            Conclusion
          </h2>

          <p>
            In conclusion, food insecurity in Syria has been caused mainly by Syrian Civil War. Syrian Civil War has had direct devastating impacts on food security of Syrians. On one hand, the war has destroyed agriculture production, killing hundred thousands of Syrians and displacing millions of them, blocking trades and humanitarian assistance, diminishing food subsidies. On the other hand, Syrian Civil War has caused loss of livelihood for millions of Syrians in term of loss of jobs or loss of the ability to work due to disability. Also, the war has impoverished future generations of Syrians in that many Syrian children are forced to abandon their education because of either the destruction of the education system at all levels or economic burdens.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, there is hope. Since the start of Syrian Civil War, various humanitarian groups have been supporting Syrians and Syrian refugees to lessen their sufferings. In “WFP Syria Country Brief March 2019”, World Food Program reports that the organization have delivered 47, 173 million tons of food to food-insecure Syrians in all 14 Syrian governorates, especially to 251,000 people in 56 hard-to-reach locations (“WFP Syria”). With international supports, the country would be able to rebuild the country once the war is over.
